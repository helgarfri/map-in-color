  <p>Hey,</p>

  <p>
    We’re excited to share that <strong>Map in Color 3.0</strong> is now live. You signed up to hear from us, so we wanted you to be among the first to know.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this release we’ve focused on a clearer, more powerful mapping experience: choropleth and categorical maps, smarter data import, and a dedicated explore space to discover and share maps with the community. You can try everything in the playground without an account, and sign up when you’re ready to save, publish, and embed.

  </p>

  <p>
    The screenshot above shows one example: a dark-themed world map of <strong>% of individuals using the Internet</strong>. You can click through ranges in the legend, see which countries fall in each band, and explore the data interactively. That’s the kind of clarity we’re aiming for across the platform.

  <p>Thanks for being part of the Map in Color community.</p>
