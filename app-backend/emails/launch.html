  <p>Hey,</p>

  <p>
    I'm excited to let you know that Mic (Map in Color) is officially live. You signed up to get notified, so I wanted to send a quick thank you for being part of this early stage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Check it out here: <a href="https://mapincolor.com" target="_blank">mapincolor.com</a>
  </p>

  <p>With Mic, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and share custom maps with your own data</li>
    <li>Discover maps made by others</li>
    <li>Save and comment on the ones you like</li>
    <li>Be part of a growing community of data lovers and curious people</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is just the start. I’ll be adding more features over time, including new map types. I’ll also be listening to feedback to help shape where it goes next. So if you have thoughts, ideas, or suggestions, just reply to this email. I’d love to hear what you think.
  </p>

  <p>Thanks again for being here early.</p>

  <p>Helgi</p>
