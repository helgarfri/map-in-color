  <p>Hey!</p>
  <p>
    After a lot of building (and rebuilding), I'm really excited to finally launch
    <strong>Mic (Map in Color)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>Check it out here: <a href="https://mapincolor.com">https://mapincolor.com</a></p>
  <p>Mic lets you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and share custom maps with your own data</li>
    <li>Discover maps made by other people</li>
    <li>Save and comment on the ones you like</li>
    <li>Be part of a growing community of map nerds, data lovers, and curious people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is just the start. More features soon, like user profiles, map of the week, and more cool datasets.</p>
  <p>If you're into maps, data, or just want to try something new, give it a shot.</p>
  <p>Feel free to reply with any thoughts or feedback. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
  <p>Thanks for being part of this early stage,</p>
  <p>Helgi</p>
