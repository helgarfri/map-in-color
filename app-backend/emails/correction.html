  <p>Hey,</p>

  <p>
    I wanted to send a quick correction regarding the email I sent earlier today about Volume 1 of the Map in Color Official Map Selection.
  </p>

  <p>
    The map shared in that email mistakenly displayed <strong>GDP per capita</strong> rather than <strong>defence expenditure per citizen</strong> — an error on my part when reading the data from NATO's 2024 report.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve decided to pause the Map Selection rollout for now and will relaunch the series next week with a fresh start. I want to make sure every map we release is accurate and thoughtful — and I appreciate your patience as I take the time to get it right.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks again for being part of the early Mic community.
