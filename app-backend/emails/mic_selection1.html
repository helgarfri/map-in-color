  <p>Hey,</p>

  <p>
    I’m excited to announce something new: <strong>Map in Color’s Official Map Selection</strong> — a weekly map created and curated by the Mic team to highlight meaningful data stories through thoughtful design and insight.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're kicking off with <strong>Volume 1</strong>: a map showing <em>Defence Expenditure per Citizen</em> across NATO countries in 2024. It shifts the focus from total military power to the <strong>financial burden per person</strong> — and the results are surprising.
  </p>

    </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Nordic countries like Iceland and Norway show high per-capita spending, while Eastern members — despite high budgets by % of GDP — rank lower here. It’s a great example of how per-person data can shift perspective.

  <p>
    This series is separate from our user-submitted maps — it's a way for us to set a tone and explore ideas using the Mic platform itself. That said, if you're creating maps too, there's a chance yours could be featured in other ways.
  </p>

  <p>Thanks for being part of the early Mic community.</p>

  <p>Helgi</p>
