    <h1>REFUND POLICY</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated February 20, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
      This Refund Policy explains how refunds work for Map in Color Pro ("Pro").
      By purchasing Pro, you agree to this Refund Policy.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Pro subscription</h2>
    <p>
      Map in Color Pro is a monthly subscription currently priced at <strong>$4.99 USD per month</strong>.
      We do not offer yearly subscriptions at this time.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Cancellation</h2>
    <p>
      You can cancel your Pro subscription at any time. After you cancel, your Pro access will remain active
      until the end of your current billing month. You will not be charged again unless you re-subscribe.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Subscription payments are generally <strong>non-refundable</strong>, except where required by applicable law.
      This includes partial-month refunds, unused time, accidental renewals, or changes in usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you believe you were charged in error (for example, a duplicate charge), please contact us and
      we will review the issue.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Payment processor</h2>
    <p>
      Payments may be processed by a third-party payment provider (for example, Paddle). Refunds (if approved)
      are typically issued back to the original payment method. Processing times can vary depending on your bank
      or payment provider.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. How to request help</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about billing, cancellation, or believe you were charged incorrectly,
      contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mapincolor.com">support@mapincolor.com</a>.
      Please include the email address used for your account and any relevant payment details (such as the date
