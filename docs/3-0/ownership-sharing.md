# Ownership & Sharing

## Map Ownership

Every saved map belongs to its creator. The creator can edit the map at any time, change its visibility (public or private), and delete the map. Map ownership is tied to the user account that created it.

## Public vs Private

**Public Maps** — Visible to all users. Others can view the map, share the link, embed it (if enabled), and download exported versions. Public maps may appear in search and explore.

**Private Maps** — Visible only to the creator. They do not appear in search or explore and cannot be viewed by other users; the creator can still export them.

## Embedding Maps

Maps can be embedded on external websites using an iframe. **Public embeds**: public maps can be embedded directly. **Private embeds (Pro Feature)**: embedding a private map requires a valid access token in the iframe URL. If the token is missing or invalid, the embedded map will not be displayed.

**Example: Map embed in a website layout**

## Profile Privacy Settings

Users can control what appears on their public profile under Privacy Settings:

- **Profile Visibility** — Control who can view your profile. "Only Me" disables all public profile display options.
- **Show Saved Maps** — Allow others to see the maps you have saved.
- **Show Activity Feed** — Display your recent activity (created maps or interactions).
- **Show Location** — Display your location on your profile.
- **Show Date of Birth** — Display your date of birth on your profile.
- **Star Notifications** — Notify others when you star a map.
