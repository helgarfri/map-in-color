# Introduction

## What is Map in Color?

Map in Color is a web-based platform for creating interactive choropleth and categorical maps from structured data. It allows users to upload their own datasets, customize map design, and control how their maps are presented and shared.

Users can adjust colors, define data ranges, add contextual information, and choose whether their maps are public or private. Maps can be downloaded as images, embedded on external websites, or shared directly within the platform.

In addition to creation tools, Map in Color provides an explore space where users can discover, save, and interact with maps created by others.

The goal of Map in Color is to provide a professional yet accessible mapping tool with a clean, intuitive interface.

## Who is it for?

Map in Color is for researchers, educators, journalists, and anyone who needs to visualize geographic data. Whether you are presenting statistics, teaching regional patterns, or building a public dashboard, you can create and share maps without coding. The playground lets you try the tool without an account; signing up unlocks saving, publishing, and embedding.
