# Getting Started

## Start Creating Immediately

You do not need an account to begin creating a map. Simply open the [Playground](/playground) to access the map editor and start uploading your data. The playground allows you to explore all core creation features without signing in.

## Saving Your Map

To save, publish, download, or share a map, you must be logged in.

If you create a map in the playground and later decide to sign up, your current map session will not be lost. Map in Color temporarily stores your map data locally. After signing in or [creating an account](/signup), you will be redirected to the `/create` session where your previous map configuration remains available. This ensures a seamless transition from exploration to ownership.

## Creating an Account

To [create an account](/signup), users must:

- Provide a valid email address
- Choose a unique username
- Create a password that meets security requirements
- Provide basic profile information (such as date of birth and location)
- Agree to the [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy)

Once registration is complete:

- Users coming from the playground will be redirected to `/create` with their active session restored
- New users signing up directly will be redirected to the `/dashboard`
